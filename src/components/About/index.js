        Hello, my name is Serge; 23 years old, and I speak fluently Russian and English. Recently I had a desire to learn new languages, and once I examined computer languages, I felt that I found what i was searching for. In order to be fluent in web development, I took a course at UC Davis bootcamp, and after completing this course I received assurance in making this new step in my career.
