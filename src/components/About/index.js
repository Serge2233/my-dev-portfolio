        Hello, my name is Serge, I'm 23 years old and I speak two languages: Russian and English. I always had an eagerness to learn new languages, and I once came up to computer languages, which took me up to learn something completely new and change my career now! I took a course at UC Davis Coding Bootcamp, and now I am a Full Stack Web Developer!
